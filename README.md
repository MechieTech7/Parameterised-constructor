# Parameterised-constructor
 The goal of this exercise is to help the students understand why constructor, how to use constructor to initialise member variables, apply simple logic of conditional statements to filter given conditions.

Create a student profile ( studentName, rollNumber, class, section, schoolname, result) and initialize the members with parameterized constructor. You can add multiple students with a combination of Pass and Fail result. 


For the student class add an operation to displayStudentProfile()
For the student class add an operation to displayProfileOf(String studentName)
For the student class add an operation to isPass()
The isPass method will check the result and return true if the student is Pass, return false if the student is Fail.

Parameterised constructor is used to pass one or more parameters at the same time.
In the above program i used to pass strings and integers as parameters.
I use boolean values for the result output.
